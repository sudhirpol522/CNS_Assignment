*Inspecting absolute paths: Ensuring that each function call pointed to the correct file location.*

*Error analysis: Reading and understanding error messages to determine the root cause.*

*Package management: Installing all necessary packages and dependencies.*
*Troubleshooting: Systematically resolving issues by following error logs and documentation.*
